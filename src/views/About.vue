            <p>
              JHR Developments has been in operation since 1995, racing in a
              number of single-seater and sportscar series. Originally set up to
              help the late Jamie Hunter compete, the team is run by Jamieâ€™s
              brother Steven in his memory, after his tragic death in 2000.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team has raced in European Formula Renault, F4 British
              Championship, Renault UK Clio Cup, Britcar, Seat Cupra Championship,
              and Porsche Carrera Cup GB, with a number of well-known drivers
              coming through the doors.
            </p>
            <p>
              For 2019 JHR Developments will return to the F4 British Championship
              while making its debut in the BRDC British F3 Championship. This
              will provide drivers with a logical progression route in their
              single-seater careers as they look to prove themselves in two of the
              toughest series on the planet.
